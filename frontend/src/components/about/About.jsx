                                        Home maker turned entrepreneur have come a long way in this journey with the vision of creating a platform for the entrepreneurs, my organisation is called The Entrepreneurs Hub (TEH) home maker turned entrepreneurs who are lacking in networking and referrals. In covid period many business ppl we're affected without any networking and connections and myself among them one was desperate and wanted to do something and got this idea of starting this organization for benefits of startup and women entrepreneurs who do business from their respective homes. Thus, this organization was born.
